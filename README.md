# Welcome to Sydney's personal website!
http://sydneyfang.me

After lots of sleepless nights and obssession with fixing bugs... my website is finally done!
It was totally worth it - the learning, frustration, excitement and satisfaction.
1000/10 I would totally do this again.

Feel free to check on the website every now and then - I will most likely update it and add to it!
Especially the chatbot, I will most likely look into changing the sequential model to make it better and train it with more data.
